Below is a list of interesting posts/papers/talks for those interested in writing safe and reliable software.


Case studies in software/hardware faults:

- [A case study of Toyota unintended acceleration and software safety](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/pubs/koopman14_toyota_ua_slides.pdf)


- [Priority inversion problem in the Mars pathfinder](https://www.rapitasystems.com/blog/what-really-happened-software-mars-pathfinder-spacecraft)

- [Real system failures](https://c3.ndc.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/) from NASA

  A lot of these slides lean towards HW and EE, but are just fantastic nonetheless -- many observed failures are of the "this won't ever happen" type (and yet, they did!).

- [Ariane 5 Disaster](https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-ariane-5-disaster/)


- [Therac 25](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf) (medical)

- [Citicorp center engineering crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicorp_Center_engineering_crisis)
 and [the building built on stilts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLXys9vgWiY) (civil)

  ... the speaker has many fantastic videos; as an example, here is the talk about [design of SR-71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3Yzjk5R4M).


- [Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale](https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/#:~:text=In%20laymen's%20terms%2C%20Knight%20Capital,NYSE%20and%20NASDAQ%20to%20bankrupt.) (finance; see also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group#2012_stock_trading_disruption))


Guidance for developing safety critical systems:

- [NASA distributed systems design checklist](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140011505/downloads/20140011505.pdf)

  A checklist and guidance on designing large safety-critical systems.


- [NASA software fault tolerance; a tutorial](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20000120144/downloads/20000120144.pdf)

  In particular, read the case study of B777 and Airbus 320.


- [Developing safety critical software](https://www.google.com/search?q=developing+safety+critical+software)

  This seems to be the standard book on the topic, with a number of aviation examples. Discussion of software practices is a bit dated though.
